learning_websockets
===================

This small app was a part of a two day learning exercise where students of the June 2014 WDI cohort at
General Assembly had to choose a topic, learn about it, and produce a small application in two days. I
chose to learn about web sockets and built this small chatting application.

It is hosted on the web at: wdichattr.herokuapp.com
